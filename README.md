# DSE241_Data_Visualization
Data visualization group projects done in D3.js, tableau and such for UCSD masters

1. Random cool visualization for people like me: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/06/business/economy/unemployment-lines.html?mtrref=www.google.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=19CF7357FAB38818F0698C156F0C30C1&gwt=pay

2. Cool for maybe final visualization to have a save button (not today maybe, but final project) https://bl.ocks.org/eesur/5d904ea198e9b219e95342dacd494f8b
