## Final Project Proposal
This is in type form rather than slide show to organize before making the file pretty. 

## Dataset: Identify and describe a publicly available dataset that will be used for this project
We have chosen the [Global Shark Attack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) from Kaggle. 

## Tasks: Specify five tasks that you intend to address with this visualization

### What problems are you trying to solve for the chosen data?
  
One issue with shark attacks is that there isnt a clear year over year trend of the progression of shark attacks over time. 
There isn't a clear map visual currently available of the the attacks globally due a lack of geocoding. It would be elucidating 
for policy makers to prevent unneeded attacks. 

### Is the visualization meant for data exploration, hypothesis confirmation or presentation

The visualization is meant for data exploration and presentation. The idea is that the visual will help show trends to better 
inform the public and policy makers. 

### What data transformation need to be undertaken to work with the data? 
There needs to be the transformation of the Country, Area, and Location columns into
one address column that will be geocoded using google maps api into long lat. 

### What are the use case scenarios?

Showing the world shark attack reporting over time. 

## How will the visualization solution be implemented? 

While there will be some work (on Michael's part) on data translation (geocoding) 
using python and the google maps API, 
this project will be mostly application dominant. (WE NEED TO INCLUDE LITERATURE SURVEY STUFF. 

Need to make a sketch or concept diagram. 

Filter for years. Zoom, filtering by fatality rate/attack type

## Who are the stakeholders? 

Public. 

## Final Proposal will obviously be in [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MfLvaYL1ykk9bxoKk0ij5tJ4mxmXP_U63pgFJLAyQ8w/edit?ts=5a6e8255#slide=id.g3295baa2ef_0_0)
